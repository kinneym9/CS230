CS230 Software Design

- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Graming Room is a company with an existing game called Draw It or Lose It, which was available on android systems. The client wanted to expand this existing game to additional platforms.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I considered the requests from the client and was thoughtful in describing design constraints associated with these requests. Additionally, for each constraint I was able to discuss a potential solution or impact these have on the development process.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

As mentioned above, listing out design constraints is very beneficial and allows for a more thoughtful development process when keeping constraints in mind throughout the process.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The recommendations section could use some more improvement. I would do more research beyond the knowledge that I currently have at this point in my learning, which would help me make more sound recommendations to develop this type of project.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Since the entire purpose of developing this application is to meet the requirements of the client, listening to their needs is an essential part of the development process. That is why all of the sections of this document were written in a way that considered all of the client's requirements for the application.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Designing software is a multi-step process and requires a lot of planning and forethought in order to make the development process efficient. In the future, I will continue to use the proper planning and documentation techniques to facilitate this.
